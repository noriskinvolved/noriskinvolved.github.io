Hello! My name is Rishav. I am currently employed at DFKI, Kaiserslautern as a research engineer. I am currently designing precision farming algorithms for agricultural robots.

I graduated from BITS Pilani, India with an undergraduate degree in Computer Science in 2020.

I completed my bachelor thesis at DFKI under [Prof. Dr. Didier Stricker](https://av.dfki.de/members/stricker/). I worked on Deep Learning for Scene Flow Estimation using monocular camera & sparse LiDAR.
